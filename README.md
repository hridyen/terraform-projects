# 🚀 Terraform Practice Projects (AWS)

This repository is a **hands-on Terraform practice playground** where I explore and implement **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** concepts using **Terraform with AWS**.  
It contains **multiple small-to-medium projects**, each focused on a specific Terraform or AWS concept.

The goal of this repo is **learning by doing** — touching almost every major Terraform topic while building real AWS infrastructure.

## 🧠 What This Repository Covers

This repo includes practical implementations of:

- Terraform core concepts (providers, resources, variables, outputs)
- State management & backends
- Data sources
- AWS infrastructure using Terraform
- Modular and reusable Terraform code
- Real-world mini projects

All projects are **practice-oriented**, not boilerplate copy-paste.
